# My Experience at GDG WOW Pune: DevFest Women Special Edition

## Introduction

Last month, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the GDG WOW (Women of Wonders) Pune DevFest - Women Special Edition. As someone passionate about technology and community building, this event was nothing short of inspiring. Here's my personal account of this transformative experience.

## The Event Setup

The event was held at the Novotel Hotel in Viman Nagar, Pune - a spacious venue that was transformed into a tech haven for the day. From the moment I walked in, the energy was palpable. The registration process was smooth, and I was greeted with a welcome kit that included some cool GDG swag, including stickers, a notebook, and a t-shirt.

The main hall was set up with a large stage for keynote speakers, while smaller rooms hosted workshops and breakout sessions. Digital screens throughout the venue displayed the agenda, making it easy to navigate between sessions.

## Morning Keynote: Breaking Barriers

The day began with an inspiring keynote by Priyanka Sharma, Executive Director at Cloud Native Computing Foundation. She shared her journey in tech, the challenges she faced as a woman in the industry, and how community support played a crucial role in her success.

Her talk wasn't just about her personal journey, but also about the importance of diversity in tech teams and how it leads to better innovation and problem-solving. One quote that particularly resonated with me was: "Diversity isn't just a nice-to-have; it's a strategic advantage in building technology that serves everyone."

## Technical Workshops

The event offered various technical tracks, and I chose to attend the Cloud & ML track. Here's a breakdown of the workshops I participated in:

### 1. Getting Started with TensorFlow

This hands-on workshop led by Smriti Jain, a Machine Learning Engineer at Google, walked us through the basics of TensorFlow. We built a simple image classification model and deployed it on Google Cloud. The session was beginner-friendly yet packed with practical knowledge.

### 2. Building Serverless Applications with Cloud Functions

In this workshop, we learned how to create, deploy, and manage serverless applications using Google Cloud Functions. The instructor, Ayushi Rawat, shared best practices and real-world examples that helped me understand when and how to use serverless architecture effectively.

## Networking Lunch

The networking lunch was a highlight of the event. Round tables were arranged with topic cards to facilitate discussion on different tech areas. I joined the "Women in AI" table and had enlightening conversations with professionals from various backgrounds - from students to senior engineers to founders. Sharing experiences and exchanging contacts over delicious food made for a perfect mid-day break.

## Panel Discussion: Navigating Tech Careers

The afternoon featured a panel discussion with women leaders from companies like Google, Microsoft, and local startups. Topics covered included:

- Strategies for career growth in tech
- Dealing with imposter syndrome
- Building support networks
- Work-life balance
- Mentorship and sponsorship

The panelists shared candid experiences and practical advice. What I appreciated most was the honesty with which they discussed their failures along with their successes.

## Lightning Talks

A series of 10-minute lightning talks showcased projects and ideas from community members. These quick presentations covered diverse topics:

- Building accessible web applications
- Getting started with open-source contributions
- Using Flutter for cross-platform development
- AI ethics considerations

I particularly enjoyed Neha Sharma's talk on "Contributing to Open Source as a Beginner" - it demystified the process and provided actionable steps to start contributing.

## Hands-on Codelabs

The event featured a dedicated space for self-paced codelabs with mentors available to help. I worked through a Firebase codelab and built a simple chat application in just an hour! Having experienced developers around to answer questions made the learning process smooth and engaging.

## Closing Session & Community Showcase

The day concluded with community project showcases where local GDG members presented their work. Seeing the innovative solutions developed by the community was incredibly motivating. The closing remarks emphasized continued learning and engagement through upcoming GDG WOW events and online resources.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Community Power**: The supportive environment reinforced that we can go further together than alone.
   
2. **Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves rapidly, and events like these provide structured opportunities to keep skills updated.
   
3. **Representation Matters**: Seeing women leading in technical roles provided tangible role models and inspiration.
   
4. **Network Value**: The connections made at such events can lead to collaborations, mentorships, and friendships.
   
5. **Practical Skills**: The hands-on nature of workshops provided immediately applicable knowledge.

## Looking Forward

This event has motivated me to become more involved with the GDG WOW Pune community. I've already signed up for their next study jam and am considering presenting at a future meetup.

For anyone hesitating to attend tech community events, especially women who might feel intimidated: please go! The GDG WOW community is welcoming, supportive, and genuinely interested in helping everyone grow in their tech journey.

Looking forward to the next GDG WOW Pune event and the opportunity to learn, share, and grow together!
