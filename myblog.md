# My Experience at GDG WOW Pune 2025

## Introduction

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share my incredible experience at the Google Developer Group Women of Wonders (GDG WOW) Pune event that took place last month. As someone passionate about technology and community building, this event exceeded all my expectations and left me feeling inspired and motivated.

## The Event Setup

The event was hosted at a stunning venue in Pune, with excellent facilities and a welcoming atmosphere. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by friendly volunteers who guided me through the registration process and provided all the necessary information about the day's schedule.

## Inspiring Keynotes

The day kicked off with a powerful keynote by a leading woman in tech who shared her journey from being the only woman developer in her team to becoming a technical leader at a major tech company. Her story resonated with many of us in the audience, highlighting the challenges women face in the tech industry and how perseverance and community support can help overcome them.

## Technical Workshops

What I loved most about the event was the diverse range of technical workshops offered:

1. **Flutter Development Workshop**: Hands-on session building a complete app from scratch
2. **Cloud Computing with Google Cloud**: Introduction to key GCP services with practical examples
3. **Machine Learning for Beginners**: A beginner-friendly introduction to ML concepts using TensorFlow

I attended the Flutter workshop and was amazed at how the instructors made complex concepts accessible to everyone, regardless of their experience level. By the end of the session, I had built my first Flutter app and gained confidence to continue learning.

## Networking Opportunities

The lunch break provided an excellent opportunity to network with other attendees. I met women from various backgrounds – students, professionals, entrepreneurs – all united by their passion for technology. These connections have already led to potential collaborations and mentorship opportunities.

## Panel Discussion: Breaking Barriers

One of the highlights was a panel discussion featuring women who have made significant contributions to the tech industry. They shared practical advice on:

- Overcoming imposter syndrome
- Building confidence in male-dominated environments
- Creating inclusive tech spaces
- Balancing career growth with personal life

Their candid stories and actionable tips were incredibly valuable.

## Community Showcase

The event also featured a showcase where community members presented projects they've been working on. It was inspiring to see the innovative solutions being developed, from accessibility apps to environmental monitoring systems.

## Key Takeaways

My main takeaways from the event were:

1. The power of community in fostering growth and learning
2. The importance of representation and role models in tech
3. Practical skills and knowledge that I can immediately apply
4. A renewed sense of purpose and motivation

## Looking Ahead

The GDG WOW Pune event has motivated me to become more active in the tech community. I plan to:

- Attend more technical workshops and meetups

- Mentor newcomers in the field

## Conclusion

The GDG WOW Pune event was more than just a technical conference; it was a celebration of women in technology and a reminder of the power of community. I left the event feeling empowered, with new skills, connections, and a renewed passion for technology.

I'm already looking forward to next year's event and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in technology, regardless of their experience level or background.
